# Glass-Assessment-Utility
There shouldn't be drive dependancy outside of the log colelction bat scripts. That part wasn't my main focus on this app, so I mostly ignored it.
You can run the current debug version of the app in the directory: \GlassSurveyAlphaTest\bin\Debug\GlassSurveyAlphaTest.exe

All bat scripts should function with the exception of the log and band steer scripts

You must have glass with USB debugging turned on, and connected/trusted to the workstation running the application.
